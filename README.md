## 📦 ARU-AGI — MVP

> **A minimally viable prototype of a digital mind**, built on reactive logic, phantoms, will, and semantic memory.
> According to the ARU-AGI project: [github.com/Mukhameds/ARU-AGI-Project](https://github.com/Mukhameds/ARU-AGI-Project)

---

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Signal Engine**: reactive model `Signal → Block → Reaction → Signal`
* 🧠 **Semantic Memory**: `QBit` structure with context, links, emotions, and tags
* 💭 **Will Generation**: `WillEngine` activates actions based on thought priority
* 👻 **GhostField**: phantoms with probabilistic activation on ambiguity or gaps
* 🔁 **Self-Reflection Loop**: ARU analyzes isolated thoughts and spawns phantoms
* 🌐 **Consciousness Hub**: tracks current mental state, emotions, and context
* 🌍 **Multithreading**: each module runs in its own loop (`go loop...`)

---

### 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

**ARU-MVP** is not based on neural networks but on a **signal-based architecture** called **Ghost Logic** —
an alternative to LLMs focused on:

* **Meaningful reactions**, not statistical probabilities
* **Immediate excitation by signal**, not long forward-pass computations
* **Memory and will** as structural elements of mind
* **Phantom activity** that emulates internal background thinking

#### 📡 Core Concepts:

| Concept       | Description                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ghost Logic` | Digital reactive thinking model: `Signal → Block → Reaction`                              |
| `QBit` Memory | Unit of semantic memory with emotion, contextual links, and tags                          |
| `Phantom`     | Background entity of doubt, search, or clarification need                                 |
| `STB`         | Signal Theory of Being — a philosophical basis where everything is a response to a signal |

### ▶️ How to Run

```bash
cd MVP_ARU_AGI
go run ./main
```

---

### 🧪 Test Files and Logs

* `тест_*.json` — log sessions and behavioral tests for ARU
* `semanticmemory.go` — the core of semantic memory system

---

### ⚠️ Status

> The MVP is stable, self-reflective, builds semantic networks and generates intentional will.

Next steps: **develop will-based logic and phantom strategies** (`clarify`, `seek`, `project`, `prioritize`, `resolve ambiguity`).
